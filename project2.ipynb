    "1. Is there an increasing trend of usage from 2017 to 2020 and is the trend the same for both Casual and Annual Member riders?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Is there a difference in usage behaviour between Casual and Annual Member riders?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Which neighbourhoods have seen the largest number of rides depart from bike stations located within their boundaries?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Which neighbourhoods have seen the largest number of rides end at bike stations located within their boundaries?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How popular is FREE RIDE WEDNESDAYS?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. How does the weather change the way people use the bike share system?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What weather features are most influential (temperature, humidity, precipitation, etc.)?\n",
    "\n",
    "8. When are people using the bike share system? How does usage vary across the year, the week, and the day?\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How did usage change in 2020 due to the pandemic and government-mandated lockdowns?\n",

    "We have also conducted a series of analyses to provide some of our own insights into the dataset. We have attempted to answer the following questions through our analyses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does bike-share usage vary depending on proximity to TTC subway and streetcar stations?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Are there seasonal or geographic trends in trip duration?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If everyone is travelling along bike paths, which bike paths are the most congested and at what times of the day?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Are people using the bike-share system to access TTC stations?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How are people using the system, is it to commute to work or to explore the city?"
